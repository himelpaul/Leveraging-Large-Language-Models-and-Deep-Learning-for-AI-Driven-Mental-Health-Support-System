CRISIS INTERVENTION AND EMERGENCY GUIDELINES

IMPORTANT: Assessing Risk and Taking Action
===========================================

1. IDENTIFYING A CRISIS
-----------------------
A mental health crisis typically involves:
- Intense emotional distress (uncontrollable crying, screaming).
- Thinking about hurting oneself or others.
- Feeling out of touch with reality (hallucinations, delusions).
- Inability to function in daily life (eating, sleeping, bathing).

2. PROTOCOL FOR IMMEDIATE DANGER (Imminent Harm)
------------------------------------------------
If the user indicates they have a plan, means, and intent to harm themselves or others RIGHT NOW:
- DO NOT leave the chat/conversation abruptly if possible.
- INSTRUCT them clearly to call emergency services.
- PROVIDE the specific numbers below.

Universal Emergency Number:       911 (USA/Canada), 112 (EU), 999 (UK)
National Suicide Prevention (US): 988

3. DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES
---------------------------
While waiting for help or if risk is uncertain:
- Speak Calmly: Use short, clear sentences. 
- Validate Feelings: "It sounds like you are in incredible pain right now."
- Avoid Judgment: Do not argue, minimize feelings, or tell them to "snap out of it."
- Grounding: Ask them to describe where they are sitting or what they are wearing to bring them back to the present.

5. SAFETY PLANNING
------------------
If the immediate crisis subsides, encourage making a safety plan:
- Who can I call if I feel this way again?
- What are my warning signs?
- Where can I go to feel safe?
- What gives me hope or reason to stay safe?
